### Monitoring Kafka with AWS CloudWatch

#### Topics Covered
- Setting up CloudWatch to monitor Kafka clusters and Kafka-related metrics.
- Optional: Using CloudWatch Logs and Alarms for proactive monitoring.


#### **Introduction**
Monitoring Kafka clusters is essential for ensuring high availability, performance, and fault tolerance. AWS CloudWatch provides robust monitoring capabilities for Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK). This document outlines how to set up CloudWatch for Kafka monitoring, including metrics, logs, alarms, and optional steps like using the CloudWatch Agent for custom metrics, leveraging AWS-native services without the need for installing agents on brokers.

### **Setting Up CloudWatch to Monitor Kafka Clusters**

#### **1. Enable Enhanced Monitoring in MSK**
Enhanced monitoring provides detailed Kafka metrics for brokers, topics, partitions, and consumer groups.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to your MSK cluster in the AWS Management Console.
2. Edit the cluster configuration and enable Enhanced Monitoring.
   - Options:
     - **Per Broker**: Metrics for each broker in the cluster.
     - **Per Topic Per Broker**: Metrics for each topic and broker combination.
     - **Per Topic Per Partition**: Detailed metrics for each partition.
3. Save the configuration and allow the cluster to update.

#### **2. View Kafka Metrics in CloudWatch**
Once Enhanced Monitoring is enabled, Kafka metrics are available in CloudWatch under the namespace `AWS/Kafka`.

#### **3. Create Dashboards for Kafka Metrics**
Use CloudWatch Dashboards to visualize Kafka metrics in one place.

**Steps:**
1. Open the CloudWatch console and select **Dashboards**.
2. Click **Create Dashboard** and add widgets for Kafka metrics.
3. Select metrics from the `AWS/Kafka` namespace and configure charts for:
   - Broker CPU utilization.
   - lag.
   - Network.
   - replication status.

### **Optional: Using CloudWatch Logs and Alarms for Proactive Monitoring**

#### **1. Enable CloudWatch Logs for MSK**
MSK can push broker logs to CloudWatch Logs for analysis and troubleshooting.

**Steps:**
1. Edit your MSK cluster and enable broker logging.
2. Choose **CloudWatch Logs** as the destination.
3. Specify a CloudWatch Log Group to store the logs (e.g., `/aws/msk/kafka-logs`).
4. Save the configuration and wait for logs to stream to CloudWatch.

#### **2. Set Up CloudWatch Alarms for Critical Metrics**
Alarms notify you of potential issues in the Kafka cluster.

**Key Alarms to Configure:**
1. **Broker Health:**
   - Alarm on high CPU utilization (`CPUUtilization > 85%`).

2. **CPU Health:**
   - Alarm if there are under-replicated partitions (`CpuIoWait > 0.6`).


**Steps:**
1. Go to the CloudWatch console and select **Alarms**.
2. Click **Create Alarm** and choose a Kafka metric from the `AWS/Kafka` namespace.
3. Set the condition (e.g., `CpuIoWait > 0.6` for 5 minutes).
4. Configure notification actions (e.g., send an email or SMS using an Amazon SNS topic).
5. Save the alarm.

#### **3. Analyze Logs Using CloudWatch Insights**
CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to query Kafka logs for troubleshooting and analysis.

**Example Queries:**
1. **Find Errors in Broker Logs:**
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /ERROR/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   ```
2. **Analyze ZooKeeper Connection Issues:**
   ```
   fields @timestamp, @message
   | filter @message like /Session expired/
   | sort @timestamp desc
   ```

### **Benefits of AWS-Native Monitoring for Kafka**
- **Agentless Monitoring:** All monitoring is natively integrated with AWS services, reducing operational overhead.
- **Real-Time Alerts:** Proactive notifications for potential issues.
- **Seamless Integration:** Logs and metrics are automatically ingested into CloudWatch.
- **Scalability:** Fully managed by AWS, scales with your MSK cluster.
- **Cost-Efficiency:** Pay only for the CloudWatch metrics and logs you use.
