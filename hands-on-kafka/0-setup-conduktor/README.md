### Setting Up Docker, Docker Compose, and Java on Amazon Linux and Ubuntu 22

This comprehensive guide walks you through the process of setting up Docker, Docker Compose, and Java (OpenJDK 11) on **Amazon Linux** and **Ubuntu 22**. Additionally, troubleshooting commands are included to assist you in case of issues during installation or configuration.

---

### **Prerequisites**
- A Linux machine (either Amazon Linux or Ubuntu 22) with `sudo` privileges.
- Internet access to download necessary packages.

---

### **Step 1: Update the System**
Before installing any packages, it is important to update the system to ensure all existing packages are up-to-date.

#### **For Amazon Linux:**
```bash
sudo yum update -y
```

#### **For Ubuntu 22:**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

---

### **Step 2: Install Required Utilities**
Install useful utilities like `zip`, `unzip`, and `tree`.

#### **For Amazon Linux:**
```bash
sudo yum install zip unzip tree -y
```

#### **For Ubuntu 22:**
```bash
sudo apt install zip unzip tree -y
```

---

### **Step 3: Install OpenJDK 11**
Install the Java Development Kit (OpenJDK 11) for Java-based applications.

#### **For Amazon Linux:**
```bash
sudo yum install java-21-amazon-corretto -y
```

#### **For Ubuntu 22:**
```bash
sudo apt install -y openjdk-11-jdk
```

Verify the installation by checking the Java version:
```bash
java -version
```

If you encounter any issues verifying Java installation, you can troubleshoot with:
```bash
which java
echo $JAVA_HOME
```

---

### **Step 4: Install Docker**

#### **For Amazon Linux:**
If you're facing issues with the Docker installation script, you can install Docker using **Amazon Linux's** package manager `yum`:

1. **Update the system:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

2. **Install Docker:**
   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y docker
   ```

3. **Start Docker service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

4. **Enable Docker to start on boot:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

5. **Verify Docker installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps
   ```

   If Docker is not running, restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

6. **Add your user to the Docker group to manage Docker as a non-root user:**
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
   **Note:** Log out and log back in for this change to take effect.

#### **For Ubuntu 22:**
1. **Install Docker using the APT package manager:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io -y
   ```

2. **Start Docker service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

3. **Enable Docker to start on boot:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   ```

4. **Verify Docker installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps
   ```

   If Docker is not running, restart the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

5. **Add your user to the Docker group:**
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```
   **Note:** Log out and log back in for this change to take effect.

---

### **Step 5: Install Docker Compose**
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

#### **For Amazon Linux and Ubuntu 22:**
1. **Download Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.22.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

2. **Make the Docker Compose binary executable:**
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
   ```

3. **Verify the Docker Compose installation:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```

   If you encounter any issues with Docker Compose, check if the path is correct:
   ```bash
   which docker-compose
   ```

---

### **Step 6: Test Docker and Docker Compose**
To ensure Docker and Docker Compose are working correctly, perform the following tests.

1. **Start a Docker Compose setup in detached mode:**

   #### **For Amazon Linux and Ubuntu 22:**
   ```bash
   cd ~
   #curl -L https://releases.conduktor.io/quick-start -o docker-compose.yml
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. **List all running containers:**
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   If no containers are running, check Docker logs for any issues:
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u docker
   ```

3. **Check all containers, including stopped ones:**
   ```bash
   docker ps -a
   ```

4. **Verify the application is accessible by making a request to `localhost` on port `8080` (if applicable):**
   ```bash
   curl localhost:8080
   ```

---

### **Troubleshooting**
In case you encounter issues during installation or usage, here are some troubleshooting steps:

#### **Docker not running:**
   - Restart Docker:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```
   - Check Docker status:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl status docker
     ```

#### **Docker Compose not found:**
   - Ensure the binary is executable:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
     ```
   - Verify the location:
     ```bash
     which docker-compose
     ```

#### **Java installation issues:**
   - Verify the installation path:
     ```bash
     which java
     echo $JAVA_HOME
     ```

#### **Permission issues with Docker:**
   - Add the user to the Docker group:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
     ```

#### **No response from Docker containers:**
   - Check container logs:
     ```bash
     docker logs <container-id>
     ```
   - Ensure ports are exposed properly in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### **Conclusion**
You have successfully installed Docker, Docker Compose, and Java on both **Amazon Linux** and **Ubuntu 22**. Your system is now ready to run containerized applications and Java-based services.
